The Seagull has no regular itinerary, but sails a free lance in any
sea and to any country where it may be profitable for her to go. Both my
father and Uncle Naboth have adventurous natures, and prefer to let fate
direct their future rather than attempt to plan a succession of tedious
and uninteresting voyages which might mean surer gain but would afford
less excitement. This has resulted, however, in a neat fortune for each
of the _Seagull’s_ three owners, and our success has encouraged us to
persist in our eccentric methods. In the merchant service our beautiful
ship is dubbed a “tramp,” and I and my chums are called “the Boy Fortune
Hunters,” Uncle Naboth “the Yankee Trader” and Captain Steele “crazy old
Peg-leg,”—because poor father has really a wooden leg, which in no way,
however, renders him less able as a skipper. But we laugh at this
harmless raillery and, well knowing that we are envied by many who thus
banter us, pursue our own way with unconcern.
